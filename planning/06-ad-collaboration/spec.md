# 06: AD Collaboration & Philosophy Formalization

## Purpose

Provide the workflow and tooling for the Athletic Director to formally define "The Port Clinton Way" philosophy, then integrate it across the entire platform — updating content, chatbot, and coach alignment.

## Context

- **Full project requirements:** `../requirements.md`
- **Project manifest:** `../project-manifest.md`
- **This split is part of:** Phase 4 (Deferred — timing depends on AD relationship)

## What This Split Delivers

1. AD interview and philosophy drafting workflow
2. AD review, refinement, and endorsement process
3. Integration of official philosophy into chatbot system prompt
4. Content alignment audit — all existing articles re-checked against finalized philosophy
5. Coach alignment process — varsity coaches review and buy in

## Requirements

### AD Interview Workflow
- Structured 30-minute interview (could be in-person, transcribed, or virtual)
- Claude drafts "The Port Clinton Way" philosophy document from the transcript
- Document covers: core values, expectations at each level, definition of success, character milestones, how sports programs work together
- AD reviews, edits, and officially endorses

### Philosophy Integration
- Chatbot system prompt updated with the AD's official philosophy (update split 04)
- Philosophy becomes the authoritative source for all guardrails and alignment checks
- Content alignment audit: every existing article re-checked against the finalized philosophy
- Articles that conflict are flagged and revised

### Coach Alignment
- Varsity coaches review the philosophy document
- Feedback loop for buy-in and adjustments
- Process for communicating philosophy to youth volunteer coaches

## Political Context (Critical)

- **Boosters role:** Catalyst, funder, and infrastructure provider — NOT the author of coaching philosophy
- **AD role:** Owner of "The Port Clinton Way" philosophy. The platform is his tool, not the Boosters' soapbox
- **Positioning:** "We built the infrastructure and researched best practices. We'd love to support you in defining and communicating a unified athletic development philosophy."
- **AD relationship:** New full-time AD, currently MS, taking over HS+MS next year. Good but new relationship with Boosters president. New AD is a golden window — they're establishing expectations and looking for resources
- **Must not feel like:** The booster club overstepping or telling coaches how to coach. Content authority flows from the school's athletic leadership

## Key Decisions from Interview

- This is the most important future piece — the platform reaches full potential only when the AD's vision is integrated
- Timing depends on AD relationship development — cannot be rushed
- Until this happens, the platform launches with universally sound content any AD would endorse

## Dependencies

| Direction | Split | What |
|-----------|-------|------|
| **Depends on** | 02 | Content library must exist to audit and update |
| **Depends on** | 03 | Platform must exist to display updated philosophy |
| **Depends on** | 04 | Chatbot must exist to update system prompt |
| **Updates** | 02 | May require content revisions based on official philosophy |
| **Updates** | 04 | Updates chatbot system prompt with authoritative philosophy |

## What This Split Does NOT Cover

- Building the platform or chatbot (splits 03, 04)
- Writing the initial universally sound content (split 02)
- Community features or user accounts (split 07)

## Success Criteria

1. The AD sees the platform as a valuable tool for his programs, not an overstep by the Boosters
2. "The Port Clinton Way" is a document the AD proudly owns and communicates
3. Chatbot responses reflect the AD's vision, not just generic best practices
4. All content has been audited and aligns with the official philosophy
5. Varsity coaches understand and support the philosophy
