# Content Library Creation — Complete Specification

## 1. Project Overview

Build a publication-ready content library of 75-100+ expert-quality articles for the Port Clinton Athletic Boosters (PCAB) knowledge base. The library covers all sports and all ages (K-12), providing evidence-based guidance for parents, coaches, athletes, and program administrators.

Content is generated by Claude Code using research capabilities, stored as MDX files, and organized with a comprehensive frontmatter taxonomy. Every article passes automated alignment checks against core philosophy principles before publication.

### Key Constraints
- **Pipeline tooling (split 01) is not yet built** — content creation proceeds independently, using MDX format and frontmatter conventions that the pipeline will later consume
- **Platform (split 03) is not yet decided** — MDX files must be framework-agnostic, compatible with Astro Content Collections, Velite, Next.js MDX, or similar
- **Athletic Director input (split 06) comes later** — content includes `[AD_INPUT_NEEDED]` placeholder blocks where the AD's specific philosophy will be injected

## 2. Content Categories & Article Scope

### 2.1 Category Structure

Articles are organized iteratively by category, completing one category before moving to the next. Earlier categories inform later ones.

| Category | Description | Target Articles |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Parent Guides** | Supporting youth athletes at every age | 15-20 |
| **Coach Resources** | Volunteer coach onboarding, practice planning, team culture | 12-18 |
| **Development Frameworks** | LTAD, multi-sport participation, periodization, physical literacy | 10-15 |
| **Health & Safety** | Concussion protocols, injury prevention, nutrition, mental health | 10-15 |
| **Community/Program Building** | Volunteer recruitment, program metrics, fundraising, coordination | 10-15 |
| **The Port Clinton Way** | Character-first philosophy, 5 Pillars, identity-based motivation | 8-12 |
| **Curated External Resources** | Vetted links with editorial context | 1 comprehensive resource page + per-article links |

### 2.2 Additional Must-Have Topics (from interview)
- Concussion awareness and recognition
- Return-to-play protocols after injury
- Equipment safety and age-appropriate gear

### 2.3 Content Standards

- **Evidence-based**: Cite LTAD, Positive Coaching Alliance, NFHS, NSCA, AAP, peer-reviewed research
- **Philosophy-aligned**: Every article passes alignment check against core principles
- **Audience-appropriate**: Parents are not coaches; volunteers are not PhDs
- **Evergreen**: Content rarely needs updating (annual review cycle)
- **Actionable**: Readers walk away with something they can do
- **Non-prescriptive on tactics**: No plays, schemes, or sport-specific drills
- **Research-cited specifics OK**: Can include specific recommendations when directly citing published research (e.g., "NSCA recommends 2-3 sets of 8-15 reps")
- **Politically sensitive**: Never positions Boosters as telling coaches how to coach; content authority flows from established research
- **Publication-ready**: Articles should be ready to publish as-is after automated alignment checks

### 2.4 Multi-Sport vs. Specialization Framing

Present both sides fairly — evidence for multi-sport participation AND legitimate reasons families choose specialization. Avoid dogmatic positions. Let the research speak for itself while acknowledging the practical reality of a small school.

## 3. The 5 Pillars of Program Success

Defined from universally accepted youth sports development research (LTAD, Positive Coaching Alliance, NSCA, AAP). These are principles any Athletic Director would endorse — not prescriptive philosophy.

The 5 Pillars will be synthesized from:
- LTAD's core principles (physical literacy, developmental age, multi-sport sampling)
- Positive Coaching Alliance's Double-Goal Coach framework
- NSCA's Ten Pillars of Long-Term Athletic Development
- AAP guidelines on youth training limits and injury prevention

Each pillar should be:
- Grounded in specific, citable research
- Applicable across all sports and age levels
- Measurable through program health metrics
- Endorsed by established organizations (not PCAB-specific opinion)

## 4. Content Voice & Tone

Establish a new brand voice for PCAB content (no existing guide). The voice should be:

- **Knowledgeable but approachable**: Expert-level information written for a general audience
- **Encouraging, not preachy**: Inspire action without lecturing
- **Evidence-based, not opinion-based**: Always cite sources; let research make the argument
- **Inclusive**: Address all ability levels, all sports, all family situations
- **Respectful of coach autonomy**: Present frameworks and research, never tell coaches what to do
- **Community-oriented**: "We" language where appropriate; reinforce shared goals
- **Practical**: Every article includes specific takeaways

### Terminology Preferences
- "Development" over "winning"
- "Physical literacy" over "athleticism"
- "Athlete development" over "player development" (sport-neutral)
- "Youth athlete" over "kid" (respectful)
- "Evidence suggests" over "you should" (non-prescriptive)
- "Age-appropriate" is preferred framing for training recommendations

## 5. MDX File Structure

### 5.1 Directory Organization

Based on research recommendation: **category-based folder structure** for navigability at scale.

```

### 5.2 Frontmatter Schema

Every MDX file must include this frontmatter (framework-agnostic YAML):

```yaml
---
title: "Article Title"
description: "150-160 character summary for SEO and social sharing"
slug: "url-friendly-identifier"
date: "2026-02-25"
lastUpdated: "2026-02-25"

### 5.3 Article Body Structure

Each article follows a consistent structure:

```mdx
{/* Frontmatter above */}

## Key Takeaways
- 3-5 bullet points summarizing actionable insights

## Introduction
Brief context setting (2-3 paragraphs)

## Main Content
### Section 1
### Section 2
### Section 3
(Organized logically for the topic)

## Practical Application
What readers can do with this information

## [AD_INPUT_NEEDED]
{/* Placeholder for Athletic Director's perspective on this topic */}
{/* Split 06 will fill these blocks with AD-specific philosophy */}

## References
Cited sources with links
```

## 6. Content Alignment Checking

### 6.1 Philosophy Principles Document

Create a structured principles document covering:
- Core values derived from the 5 Pillars
- Terminology standards (preferred and avoided terms)
- Tone guidelines
- Claims that must always be supported by citations
- Anti-patterns to detect (early specialization promotion, win-at-all-costs framing, coaching prescription)

### 6.2 Automated Validation

Each article is checked against:
1. **Terminology alignment** — Uses preferred terms, avoids discouraged terms
2. **Age-appropriateness** — Training recommendations match stated age group
3. **Tone consistency** — Positive, encouraging, evidence-based
4. **Citation verification** — Claims cite published research
5. **Anti-pattern detection** — No early specialization promotion, no excessive training loads, no coaching prescription
6. **Frontmatter completeness** — All required fields present with valid values
7. **Cross-reference integrity** — Related articles exist and are reciprocal

### 6.3 Alignment Score

Each article receives a 1-5 alignment score:
- **5**: Fully aligned, publication-ready
- **4**: Minor adjustments needed (terminology, tone)
- **3**: Moderate issues (missing citations, borderline prescriptive)
- **2**: Significant alignment issues
- **1**: Major violations (prescriptive coaching, unsupported claims)

Target: All published articles score 4 or 5.

## 7. Curated External Resources

### 7.1 Resource Selection Criteria
- Published by established organizations (PCA, NFHS, NSCA, AAP, Canadian Sport for Life)
- Evidence-based, not opinion-based
- Aligned with PCAB's development-first philosophy
- Freely accessible (no paywalled content unless essential)
- Current (updated within last 3 years)

### 7.2 Editorial Context Format

**Key resources** (major organizations, foundational documents): Full editorial write-up (150-250 words) explaining:
- What the resource covers
- Why it's relevant to PCAB's mission
- How it aligns with specific Pillars
- Who should read it and when

**Standard resources** (supplementary articles, tools): Brief annotation (2-3 sentences) covering what it is and why it's included.

## 8. Athletic Director Placeholder System

Articles include `[AD_INPUT_NEEDED]` blocks where the Athletic Director's specific input will be injected during split 06. These blocks:
- Are clearly marked with consistent syntax
- Include a brief description of what input is needed
- Specify the type of content expected (philosophy statement, program-specific example, endorsement)
- Can be searched/filtered programmatically for the split 06 integration

Format:
```mdx
{/* [AD_INPUT_NEEDED]
   Type: philosophy-statement
   Context: How the AD views multi-sport participation at Port Clinton
   Guidance: 2-3 paragraphs on the AD's personal stance and how it shapes program decisions
*/}
```

## 9. Content Generation Workflow

### 9.1 Iterative Category Approach
1. Select next category to write
2. Define article topics for that category (informed by research and previous categories)
3. Generate articles one at a time with full research
4. Run alignment check on each article
5. Iterate until category is complete
6. Move to next category

### 9.2 Per-Article Process
1. Research the topic using web sources and established frameworks
2. Draft the article following the body structure template
3. Complete all frontmatter fields
4. Run alignment validation
5. Verify cross-references to existing articles
6. Mark as publication-ready (status: published)
