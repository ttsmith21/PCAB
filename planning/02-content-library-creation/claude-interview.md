# Interview Transcript — Content Library Creation

## Q1: Sports and Age Groups

**Question:** What sports are offered at Port Clinton, and which age groups does the Boosters program cover?

**Answer:** All sports, all ages (K-12). Every sport the school offers, from youngest rec leagues through varsity.

## Q2: Pipeline Tooling Status

**Question:** What is the current state of the content pipeline tooling from split 01?

**Answer:** Not started yet. Split 01 hasn't been built — content creation will happen before or in parallel with pipeline tooling.

## Q3: Platform/Framework

**Question:** What platform/framework is the knowledge base being built on?

**Answer:** Not decided yet. Platform choice hasn't been finalized.

## Q4: The 5 Pillars of Program Success

**Question:** Can you describe what the 5 Pillars are, or should the content define them from universally accepted youth sports development principles?

**Answer:** Define from research. Create the 5 Pillars based on LTAD, Positive Coaching Alliance, and established frameworks — universally sound principles any AD would endorse.

## Q5: Content Directory Structure

**Question:** Should articles be organized by category folders or flat with metadata-driven categorization?

**Answer:** Use whatever the research suggests is best practice (Claude's recommendation).

## Q6: Content Quality Bar

**Question:** What's the expected content quality bar?

**Answer:** Publication-ready. Articles should be ready to publish as-is after automated alignment checks.

## Q7: External Resources Format

**Question:** How extensive should the curated external resources list be, and what format?

**Answer:** Mix based on importance. Key resources get full editorial write-ups, others get brief 2-3 sentence annotations.

## Q8: Coaching Advice Boundary

**Question:** How should articles handle the line between 'evidence-based development guidance' and 'coaching advice'?

**Answer:** Research-cited specifics are OK. Can include specific recommendations when directly citing published research (e.g., 'NSCA recommends 2-3 sets of 8-15 reps'), but not prescriptive coaching tactics.

## Q9: Brand Voice

**Question:** Is there an existing brand voice or tone guide?

**Answer:** Establish new voice. Define the content voice/tone as part of this project — no existing guide.

## Q10: Athletic Director References

**Question:** How should content handle AD role references given split 06 dependency?

**Answer:** Placeholder blocks. Include marked placeholder sections (e.g., [AD_INPUT_NEEDED]) that the AD fills in during split 06.

## Q11: Multi-Sport vs. Specialization Framing

**Question:** How should articles handle the multi-sport vs. specialization topic?

**Answer:** Balanced presentation. Present both sides fairly — evidence for multi-sport AND legitimate reasons families choose specialization.

## Q12: Content Planning Approach

**Question:** Should we define the full topic list upfront or generate iteratively?

**Answer:** Iterative by category. Complete one category at a time, letting earlier categories inform later ones.

## Q13: Additional Must-Have Topics

**Question:** Any specific content topics to include beyond the spec's category lists?

**Answer:** Concussion & safety protocols. Include articles on concussion awareness, return-to-play protocols, and equipment safety.
