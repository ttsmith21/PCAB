# Code Review: Section 04 - Payment Confirmation Page

The implementation is high quality and matches the plan requirements very well. The page structure, styling, imports, metadata, and all four steps are correctly implemented. The code follows the established pattern from /join/thanks. All required constants are properly used.

No blocking issues found. The implementation follows the plan's structure and all 5 tests pass.
