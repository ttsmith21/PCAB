# Code Review: Section 01 - Test Setup

Implementation matches specification perfectly. All required dependencies are installed with correct versions (@testing-library/react v16.3.2 supporting React 19, @testing-library/jest-dom v6.9.1, vitest v4.0.18, @vitejs/plugin-react v5.1.4, jsdom v28.1.0). The vitest.config.ts file is correctly configured with jsdom environment, globals: true, React plugin, @/* path alias using path.resolve(__dirname, './'), and setupFiles pointing to ./__tests__/setup.ts. The __tests__/setup.ts file properly imports @testing-library/jest-dom/vitest and includes the vitest/globals type reference. The sanity.test.ts file contains the trivial passing test as specified. The package.json script has been correctly updated with 'test': 'vitest run'. No issues detected - the infrastructure is ready for subsequent sections.
